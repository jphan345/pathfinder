# Pathfinder
Find the shortest path from point A to point B.

## Instructions
Click on the squares next to **'DRAW'** to change what you are drawing on the grid.

**'SEARCH'** begins the pathfinding algorithm to find a path from point A to point B.
**NOTE:** Moving diagonally counts as only 1 square, so the algorithm may sometimes move diagonally instead of in a straight line. However, the length of the path is still the same as if it moves straight.

**'RESET'** clears the walls if the pathfinding algorithm is not active, otherwise it stops the algorithm.
