# Pathfinder
Find the shortest path from point A to point B using A* search algorithm.

## Instructions
Click on the squares next to **'DRAW'** to change what you are drawing on the grid.

**NOTE:** Weight nodes take more effort to cross than normal empty nodes.

**'SEARCH'** begins the pathfinding algorithm to find a path from point A to point B.

**'RESET'** stops the algorithm and clears the path if there are paths on the board or if the algorithm is running. Otherwise, it clears all walls and weight nodes.

Click on **Algorithms** to choose an algorithm.
